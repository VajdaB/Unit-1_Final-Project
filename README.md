# Unit-1_Final-Project
<h1>By the time I'm finished with this project, if all goes well, it will be of a the USS Enterprise, piloted by the player, that explores "the final frontier" in a universe full of randomly generated and tinted planets with a hyperspace feature.</h1>
<p>I was inspired by Star Trek (which is why my entire project is based around it) and decided to 3-D design the 3-D Enterprise. That led into a desire to be able to do something with that starship, not just have it orbit the single planet in the middle of the screen. With help, I created more planets and made a universe.</p>
